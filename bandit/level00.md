## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

In this level, I learned how to **log in to remote devices using SSH (Secure Shell)**.
Before attempting this challenge, I didnâ€™t fully understand what SSH was, so I took some time to research it.
I learned that SSH is a **secure protocol for connecting to remote servers** over a network, allowing encrypted communication and command execution.

Thanks to this level, I now understand the basic syntax of the `ssh` command and how it works.
I successfully logged into the **OverTheWire Bandit server** from my own device using SSH â€” which felt like my first real step into the world of cybersecurity and Linux system access.
