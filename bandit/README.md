# Bandit OverTheWire – Learning Journey

This folder documents my **step-by-step journey through the Bandit wargame** on [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/).  

For each Bandit level, I created a separate Markdown file.

Through Bandit, I gained hands-on experience with:

- **Linux command line** (file manipulation, navigation, permissions, text processing)  
- **SSH and authentication** (password and key-based login)  
- **Text processing tools**: `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `tr`, `sort`, `uniq`, `strings`  
- **File identification and decoding**: `file`, `xxd`, `base64`, `gunzip`, `bunzip2`, `tar`  
- **Problem-solving workflow**: inspect → identify → act → verify  

This structured approach reinforces skills that are essential for cybersecurity, system administration, and CTF challenges.
