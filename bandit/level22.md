*This level is basically the previous level just a bit modified. We are supposed to look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed regularly.

* We get the same files we got in the previous level. Since we are now in level 22 we need to in cronjob_bandit23.


* As in the previous level we can see that there is a shell script that is being executed every second.
