# Bandit Level 0 → Level 1

For this level all we got to do is login into the overthewire device from our device using ssh. The credentials(username, password, the host and also the port is not the default 22, it is also provided) are provided. We just need to ssh our way into the remote device and get on.

In this level, I learned how to **log in to remote devices using SSH (Secure Shell)**.
Before attempting this challenge, I didn’t fully understand what SSH was, so I took some time to research it.
I learned that SSH is a **secure protocol for connecting to remote servers** over a network, allowing encrypted communication and command execution.
