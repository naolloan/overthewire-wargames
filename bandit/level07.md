# Bandit Level 7 â†’ Level 8

This level is actually easier than the previous two levels. We are given a pattern, so all we got to do is use `grep`. The pattern is that the password is next to a word `millionth` in a file called `data.txt`.So the command we are looking for is `grep millionth data.txt` and the password should be displayed along with the word millionth.
